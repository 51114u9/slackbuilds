.SH NAME
josm \- Java OpenStreetMap Editor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B josm
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B josm 
is an extensible editor for OpenStreetMap written in Java 6.
.PP
\fBOpenStreetMap\fR is a project aimed squarely at creating and providing
free geographic data such as street maps to anyone who wants them. It
allows you to view, edit and use geographical data in a collaborative way
from anywhere on Earth.
.PP
The project was started because most maps you think of as free actually
have legal or technical restrictions on their use, holding back people
from using them in creative, productive or unexpected ways.
